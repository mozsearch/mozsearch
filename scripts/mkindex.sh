# This script also depends on a `handle_tree_error` function having been defined

# (failure) exit code if the `on_error` tree mode was "halt" or a zero (success)
# exit code if the mode was "continue".
#
# We annotate a bunch of analysis-related steps with the error handler here
# because they seem potentially prone to breakage due to changes in the tree but
# where the breakage is recoverable in the sense that if we keep going, nothing
# else is likely to break.  It's possible that some of these steps failing will
# in fact turn out to be fatal later on, but we can address that as situations
# arise.
