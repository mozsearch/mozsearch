Big tasks:
* Autocomplete
* Display links to nearby methods in sidebar
* Better click UI that includes comments, IDL, etc.
* Multiple panes for looking through every reference in a file
* Searching for declarations

UI:
* Crossref result matches in bold
* Get rid of Nunjucks (context menu)
* "Search substring" context menu option
* Allow "locking on" a given highlighted symbol (from Kris)
* Incrementally load search results for less jank

AWS:
! Automatic indexing
! Error reporting
* Better security
* Multiple web hosts for performance

C++ indexing:
* Index specialized types (templated, etc.)
* Better indexing with inheritance (don't just search from root method)

JS indexing:
* Indexing of test files

Other indexing:
* IPDL
* HTML
* WebIDL?

IDL:
* Need to index the name of the IDL class as a type.

Searching for declarations:
Perhaps I'll make an index file that can be used to augment the full text search.
This would be similar to augmenting it with filenames.
When doing the analysis, a given decl would generate a fully-qualified name and a line/column number.
This could be a separate kind of analysis line; maybe it could be called "index". I could
also use this for JS, where you could search for ClassName.PropertyName.
The search feature would probably just grep through this file since I want to allow substring searches.
Not sure if that would be fast enough, but it might not be too bad. It would just be defs.
Or I could put in each level of qualification as a separate thing, and they would have to type
a prefix. That way I could do a binary search, which would be much faster.

C++:

For a given (static type, method) combo, I think I should have one
canonical set of results regardless of whether you're searching from a
def or a use. That set will include:
  - all possible method defs that can be dispatched to from that static type
  - all possible call sites that might call those methods
  - related methods up the inheritance chain?

class A {
  virtual void foo() {}
  // Result for def:A#foo
  // Searches for use:A#foo
};

class B : A {
};

class C : B {
  virtual void foo() {}
  // Result for def:A#foo, def:B#foo, def:C#foo
  // Searches for use:A#foo, use:B#foo, use:C#foo, def:A#foo
};

int main() {
  A* a;
  B* b;
  C* c;

  a->foo();
  // Searches for def:A#foo, use:A#foo
  // Result for use:A#foo

  b->foo();
  // Searches for def:B#foo, use:A#foo, use:B#foo
  // Result for def:B#foo

  c->foo();
  // Searches for def:C#foo, use:A#foo, use:B#foo, use:C#foo
  // Result for use:C#foo
}

What sort of pretty names should I use throughout all this?
