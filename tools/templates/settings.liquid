      <h2>About Searchfox Settings</h2>
      <p>
        This page describes and allows you to change your searchfox settings.
        Settings are stored in LocalStorage and so will be specific to your
        profile and any user container.  Settings only control client-side
        JavaScript decision-making and are never directly sent to the server,
        although settings can affect what requests are sent to the server.  Per
        the <a href="https://www.visophyte.org/blog/2022/10/05/andrews-searchfox-vision-2022/">
        current searchfox vision doc</a>, because URLs are intended to be
        shareable and consistent, a shared URL may assume the existence of a
        feature and effectively enable it while viewing that page so that the UI
        experienced is consistent and not bizarrely broken.  The user's settings
        in LocalStorage will not be affected, however, and when transitioning
        back to a page that doesn't assume a feature, the user will return to
        their normal flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Settings are organized into three categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Widget Enable/Disable.  Searchfox widgets are pieces of functionality
          that operate independently from each other.  They are conceptually
          similar to web-extensions; when enabled they can add menu items to the
          context menu and new interactable HTML to the fancy bar, but they will
          not directly interact with other widgets or core features in a way
          that would introduce functionality combinatorial explosions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Core Feature Quality Gates.  As new functionality is added to
            searchfox, it moves through several quality levels: alpha, beta, and
            release.  Alpha features are under active development and
            experimentation which can result in continual changes to the user
            experience and where the experience may be brittle.  Beta features
            have reached a stable experience, but one that it's not clear is
            appropriate to yet push to users who primarily are interested in the
            searchfox experience they are used to.  In particular, during 2023
            it's likely new development will only promote features to beta with an
            eye towards polishing their interaction near the end of 2023 and
            then promoting many of those features to release simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless abandoned, core features are always moving in the direction
            of being enabled.  This means we can have features like "remove X"
            as we don't have a concept of "disabling" a feature.  As a user, if
            you don't want a specific feature and it hasn't yet reached
            "release", then you can set your quality gate for that feature to
            "release" even if you your global quality gate set to "alpha" or
            "beta", but eventually that feature will become enabled when it hits
            release.  That said, "behavior" settings are always a possibility as
            long as they don't create combinatiorial explosions that complicate
            maintenance and development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing the theme of avoiding creating combinatorial explosions,
            features do not interact with each other, they only depend on each
            other.  This means as new alpha/beta features evolve that initially
            operate in isolation, new dependencies on other features may be
            added that could disable the feature until you enable the other
            features.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Behavior: A setting that changes how a core feature or a widget
          behaves.  Behavioral settings should ideally operate independently
          from each other to avoid combinatorial explosion that is hard to test
          or reason about.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As we implement new functionality in 2023 and pick new defaults, we are
        currently trying to strike a balance between maintaining muscle memory
        and exposing new functionality that's additive but without disrupting
        the experience you had from searchfox at the end of 2022.  This is not a
        commitment to never change anything or to add preferences for
        everything, but it is a recognition that there needs to be a high bar
        for changes that are not opt-in or which cannot be opted-out of.  It is
        also a recognition that most new functionality will be developed
        iteratively in consultation with the (actively involved) userbase, and
        so there is likely to be a non-trivial amount of churn for new
        functionality, so new functionality needs to be opt-in until the
        experience has stabilized.
      </p>

      <h2>Alpha/Beta/Release Default Core Feature Gate</h2>
      <p>
        As discussed above, core features are either alpha quality, beta
        quality, or release quality.  This default setting controls what quality
        is chosen if you do not choose a specific per-feature quality.  For
        example, you could choose the default quality gate of "release", but for
        specific features you are interested in, choose "alpha".  If you end up
        not liking the churn of the feature, you could switch those features to
        "beta" so you can experience them again when they're improved /
        stabilized.

      <h2>Source Listings</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Page Titles Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          What do you want the document.title of source listing pages to be?
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, searchfox has the following sources of information available
          for use when titling the page from most specific to most generic:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The line selection.  Searchfox source listing pages interpret their
            anchors as a comma-delimited list of line-number ranges.  All lines
            covered by the ranges will be higlighted, and the page will be
            scrolled so that the first anchored line is fully visible.  When you
            click on a searchfox link result or use a "go to" context menu
            option, searchfox will currently generate a direct line-number link.
            Heuristics are used to attempt to extract the likely symbol that the
            line selection is attempting to identify.
          </li>
          <li>
            The most specific <code>position: sticky</code> nesting area
            currently displayed at the top of the window.  When possible, source
            listings attempt to provide you with the context of what namespace,
            class, and method you're looking at by having them stick to the top
            of the viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            The filename of the source file, not including the path.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Originally, only the filename (sans path) was displayed, but starting
          in mid 2021 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702319">
          an attempt was made</a> to provide more context by adding line
          selection and "sticky" title in that order, followed by the filename.
        </p>
        <form>
          <fieldset>
            <legend>Page Title Data Sources Other Than Filename</legend>

          Automatically collapse the navigation panel on narrow windows to avoid

        </p>

        <p>
          The default value is chosen so that an 80-character-wide source view fits
          without being obscured by the navigation panel.

        The Fancy Bar is going to replaces the navigation bar on the right side

        widgets that exist to provide context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fancy Bar currently includes the following widgets:
