Design for add-ons repo:
- Will download the latest version of every public add-on.
- Will unzip the XPI.
- Directory structure will be:
    `${prefix1}/${prefix2}/${addonId}/${addonName}/${fileId}/...`
- Will unzip any subsidiary jar files within the addon.

This will probably be quite large in the end. Many gigabytes.
I'll only allow full-text searching--no analysis. That wouldn't be
very useful and it would be wasteful of memory and disk.
There also won't be any blame information.

I'll tar all this up at the end and upload it to AWS, like all the
other stuff.
