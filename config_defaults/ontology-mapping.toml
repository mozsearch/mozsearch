# ### Runnables ###
#
# The mappings here specify rules that annotate all descendant overrides of
# virtual runnable methods so that when we encounter them in the crossref
# process that we are able to generate `RunnableConstructor` slot edges to their
# constructors and corresponding `RunnableMethod` slot edges back from the
# constructors to the runnable methods.  These will be followed by the
# "traverse" command instead of getting into the infrastructure boilerplate
# around runnables.
